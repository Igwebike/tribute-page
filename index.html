        <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones.
            i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and
            a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspiredme to one day and go for and work with
            the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow my Steve
            jobs way and make Apple greater than before ir was . But i will dearly miss Steve jobs
            he's a great man and i will never forget him.

        <h3>Steve jobs</h3>
        <p>What a impact has Steve jobs has on my life? Every short story i've written
          as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email
          i've ever written, has been written on machines crested by Apple. I interacted onlione
          using an apple machine long before i ever encountered a Pc. Steve jons helped to realize the 
          star trek future i dreamed of as a kid and through his vision. i have been able to realize
          my Own. you will be missed, Mr Jons. Thans for all your amazing work.
